Tools for weakly supervised sequence labeling and span classification in biomedical text. Code is provided for training and evaluating Snorkel models for unsupervised ensembling of dictionary and other heuristic methods of labeling text.
 
**Benchmark Tasks**

 - 4 NER tasks from scientific literature (BC5CDR) and EHRs (ShARe/CLEF, i2b2) for *Disease, Chemical, Disorder, Drug* entities
 - 2 span classification (ShARe/CLEF, THYME) (*Negation*, *Temporality*) 

See `scripts/` for experiment code.
